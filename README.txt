This folder contains the solution for programming assignment 2,
the simple drawing program. Ideally you should be able to unzip the file
(which you've probably already done) and execute prog2.exe -- press h or H to
display help information.

If the executable does not work on your system, you may also try relinking the
object file (prog2.obj) on your system; a Makefile is provided for this
purposes.
